Tests
=====

All tests should be included in this directory.
Consider separating tests into `unit_tests/`, `integration_tests/`, and `regression_tests/` directories, and further subdivide them into `Python/` and `Fortran/` tests.
Tests should be run using the `unittest` framework and the `testflo` package.
